  <p>In a word, amazing!!!!!!! In other words, it’s the kind of experience that you have to see to believe!!!! Packed with action, emotion, and surprises, Spider-Man No Way Home is franchise fan service at it’s finest… Spider-Man No Way Home honestly reached my skyscraper high expectations, which is an impressive achievement itself. A true celebration of decades of Spider-Man love, this is a film for the fans. I hardly get overly emotional over films, but this one had me in my feelings by the end of it! The fact that all three Spider-Men that I grew up watching were all in the same film was extremely cool!!!!!! I am glad that I was able to experience that in the same room with so many other people. My screening was almost packed and for the first time ever, people actually cheered!!!!!!! I’m from the UK and that is not a common thing like it is in the US… Not everyone cheered unfortunately but it was enough for me to realise just how important these characters mean to some people…including me!!!! As soon as And

    <p>Thor embarks on a journey unlike anything he's ever faced -- a quest for inner peace. However, his retirement gets interrupted by Gorr the God Butcher, a galactic killer who seeks the extinction of the gods. To combat the threat, Thor enlists the help of King Valkyrie, Korg and ex-girlfriend Jane Foster, who -- to his surprise -- inexplicably wields his magical hammer. Together, they set out on a harrowing cosmic adventure to uncover the mystery of the God Butcher's vengeance.
